        <pre id="intro" class="output"><h3>Intro.</h3>
Just to start, let me introduce myself. 

I am Odinn, A Graphics Gesigner for <c>10+</c> years from the Netherlands specialized in UI/UX since 2018.
One of my hobbies is playing and getting endulged with <c>OSRS</c> and its lore.

The love for this game, my itches for graphics design, <a href="https://secure.runescape.com/m=news/proposed-mobile-user-interface-changes?oldschool=true">and the latest blog post Proposing a redesign</a> for the mobile UI made me do this writeup. 

I would like to preface this article with the message that this is a very subjective and rudementary analasys and write up, conventionally there are many more aspects to look at and things to do, this does not provide an accurate explanation of what a UX specialist does.

Anyways, Enjoy!
</pre>

        <pre id="analasys" class="output"><h3>Analasys.</h3>
Before i suggest possible solutions and-or fixes to the proposed and current ui, we should take a moment to analyse the function of the <c>mobile UI</c> that is in place today.

<section class="img-container">
    <img src="img/current UI.jpg">
    <img src="img/original ui expanded.png">
</section>

The two examples shown here are the current UI for mobile, one minimised, the other expanded.
note that the <c title="the rectangular panel on the right with interactable items within">Inventory Panel</c> will switch sides to which <c title="the square buttons on each side of the screen to hide/show specific panels">'stone'</c> is selected.

The function of the current UI is to serve the Desktop experience to a handheld platform. 
This it did well, it keeps the <c title="the nostalgic pre-2007 runescape feel">OS</c> feel and looks with variations fitting for mobile. 
the <c title="the textbox with messages from the game or players respectively">chat placement</c>, the vertical layout of the stones and the switching sides of the Inventory Pannel bring in the functionallity from Desktop in an expected way to mobile.

<c title="JAMFLEX">Jagex</c> presented these functions in a respectable manner, is this the correct way to do that? That's what i hope to answer in this writeup.

<h4>Heatmap.</h4>
<section><img src="img/heatmap.png"></section>
<r>note without actual data the heatmap image is speculation based on personal experience and importance of UI elements, and other factors explained later.</r>

With the presented heatmap i would like to illustrate the importance of elements, and to show where the <c>focus</c> is requested during regular gameplay.

The most important elements arguably are the <c>inventory panel, the prayer panel and the spellbook panel</c>. these panels are core to succesfull gameplay and require frequent focus from the player; during battle to heal, pray and <c>gear switch</c>, during bankstanding to hig-alc and craft, and last but not least, to travel and explore throught the game. if any of these three panels are omitted the game could not function properly.

Now looking at the <c>hotspots</c> your focus is spread out throughout the entire screen, from left to right and through the middle. 

The better part of this layout is that both sides of the screen are used so a palyer can use both hands to perform actions. sadly this is hindered by the need to switch panels. this requires the player to <c>refocus sporadically</c> on the specific elements, which is amplified with the size of some spells, items and status orbs. 

The players eye travels quite the <c>distance</c> during gameplay and with that one could lose focus on the objective at hand.

<h4>Heatmap v2.</h4>
<section>
    <img src="img/Mobile_3.png" alt="" srcset="">
    <img src="img/heatmap new ui.png" alt="" srcset="">
</section>
With the proposed UI the focus shifts and shrinks, to the right and center.
this allows for new UI elements.
in this case it allows for extended control settings a dedicated logout button and a section for a <c title="area for more information that power users need for efficient gameplay.">'Power User Panel'</c>.

The Chat box changes to a more vertical control scheme, shrinking the F pattern covering the chat and the rest of the left side.
<c><sub> F pattern is the usual read direction of prominently a western person. this creates inherent heat spots.</sub></c>
This again eleviates the focus and eye travel, to allow faster focus on more important things.

However! Now with the relieved space, the new Toutch controls and the dedicated logout button unnessarily <c>clutter</c> up the won realestate.

The chat controls, however are a step in the <c>right direction</c>, they obfuscate the previous eassily accessible buttons (some more usefull than others).
</pre>

        <pre id="suggestion" class="output">
<h4>Suggestions.</h4>
So with the analasys taken in concideration. lets take a look at some suggestions, and build it up from a clean slate.

<section>
    <img src="img/no-ui.png" alt="">
</section>
Hiding all the UI elements shows how much <c>real estate</c> we have to work with. The player now can purely focus on the character and it's enviroment. 
However, as discussed before we need a few elements to have a <c>functioning game</c>. The inventory, the data orbs and the panel stones.

The first think i would like to add are the <c>Stones and the data orbs!</c>

<section>
    <img src="img/stage-1.png">
</section>
For the data orbs, the suggested ones sorts them in a <c>neater and more intuitive</c> manner. than the current minimised version. note the minimap can be brought back with the globe button.

The stones I decided to use are the ones form the suggested UI. The order of the stones make the distinction between the <c>primary</c> (inventory, prayer, magic, attack styles)
and <c>the secondary stones</c> (Exp, emotes, friends/clan list, acc settings, more) and allows the user to collapse the stones to just the primary.

<sub>Sadly this does not allow us to use both of our hands. If we could have multiple panels open at the same time this would be the best, but this is in direct conflict to what we expect from the Desktop interface.</sub>

There's a <c>lot of good</c> about the new ui, however lets nuke the dedicated logout button and controls, and come back to it later, but bring just the powerpanel button back. I would also like to concolidate all chat buttons to a <c>single one</c>. 

<section>
    <img src="img/stage-2.png" alt="">
</section>
One of the stronger elements in the new UI is the existence of the <c>Power Panel</c>, this deserves to stay, but should be used for more than just information.

The chat I suggest would, like in minecraft, <c>pop up and fade</c> away with a max of four lines. 
now obviously sometimes you want to read back to what is said or what happened in game. we can like with the powerpanel <c>expand it</c> by clicking on the button in the top left, this will show an <c>extended chat box</c> with tabs and allows you to chat with the players around you.

<section>
    <img src="img/stage-3.png" alt="">
    <img src="img/stage-4.png" alt="">
</section>
In the first image you see the <c>minimised</c> Power pannel, in the case of exp it would only show the specefied tracker, be it total exp, or any of the specific skills. 
This is to <c>limit the clutter</c> of the screen but can be expanded to show the other capabilities of the powerpanel.
the first image also shows us the <c>fading chat bar</c> now with only the last message visible.

The second image shows us the expanded chat bar with all the tab buttons and <c>archive</c> and allows the player to chat. It also allows us to set a filter or limit the chat to one <c>specific category</c> of messages.

<section>
    <img src="img/stage-5.png" alt="">
    <img src="img/stage-6.png" alt="">
</section>
The <c>Power Panel</c> provides us with a new way to interact with the game through information and the likes, We can however use it for more than just that, in this case i moved the <c>toutch controls</c> from the suggested UI to the powerpanel and gave it a horizontal layout, same <c>functionality</c> applies to as before.

The power panel could also provide us with an area where we could move specific <c>settings and controls</c>, like the game settings and the world switcher & logout button.

My suggestion for the <c>world switcher</c> is the following.
for the minimised bar, have a direct logout button and 2 of your <c>favorite worlds</c> for quick a quick hop.
for the extended version we could bring in the full <c>filterable</c> world list for easier navigation through the different worlds.

we can <c>populate</c> the power panel with information about slayer, your home build options, it could <c>provide statistics</c> about the latest loot you collected, or information about your party, it can be <c>used for so much</c> more than just raw information.

For each Power panel we would have a minimised version for ease of use and a <c>maximised version</c> for more nuanced control and information.

    <h4>Conclusion.</h4>
This was my <c>rudementary</c> Analasys and Suggestions to the UI of OSRS.

<section>
    <img src="img/final.png">
</section>
Usually I would do <c>A-B tests</c>, do interviews with a sample group, look at analytical data and generate a <c>heatmap</c> accordingly, design a flowchart and take all interfaces in account while doing these analasys. today i have just <c>focussed on the direct UI</c> and the user experience within.

Thank you for reading thorugh my <c>rambling</c> and making it to the end of this writeup. I hope i have informed you with my analasys, and hope that the suggestions that were made will help you develop a <c>more user friendly UI</c> while still including the powerpanel in a neat and nice way.

Thank you <c>Jagex</c> for makign a game for me and many others to relive our <c>nostalgia</c> and experience new challenges.
